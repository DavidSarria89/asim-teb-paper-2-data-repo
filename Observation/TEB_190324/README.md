* `energy_bins_hed.txt` : energy bins used for HED data (keV), used for the chi^2 analysis

* `energy_bins_led.txt` : energy bins used for LED data (keV), used for the chi^2 analysis

* `LED_energy_list.txt` : LED energy list in keV. Minimum energy of 50 keV. Some energies are above 370 keV: they are real counts, but saturated. They are used for the lightcurve and the HED/LED count ratio, but not for the spectrum.

* `Lightcurve_HED_obs_HR.txt` : lightcurve for HED. first column is the tine bin edges (ms) and second is counts per bin per bin size. Third column is the x-bin half-size. Fourth column is the 1-sigma error bar (on y).
* `Lightcurve_LED_obs_HR.txt` : same for LED
