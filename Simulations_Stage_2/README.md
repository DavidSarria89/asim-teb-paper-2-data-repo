* Simulation results after stage 2 (response of the detector). The resolution of the instruments should also be applied (~15% at 511 keV for HED, and <5% for LED). When this resolution is applied it is possible to de-multiply the number of simulated counts by several folds.

* each file is named `simu_XXX_energy_list_YYY.txt` and contain a list of energies in keV. `XXX` is for LED or HED. `YYY` is for a different source TGF energy spectrum, as described in the paper:
    * MV160: leader 160 MV
    * MV300: leader 300 MV
    * RREA65: epsilon=6.5 MeV
    * RREA: epsilon=7.3 MeV
    * RREA80: epsilon=8.0 MeV
    * RREA100: epsilon=10.0 MeV
