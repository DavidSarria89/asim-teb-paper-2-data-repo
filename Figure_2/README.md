Contains the observation data, binned:
* Energy spectrum:
    * `Ener_spec_HED_obs.txt` : for HED, first column is the energy bin edges (keV) and second is counts per bin per bin size. Third column is the x-bin half-size. Fourth column is the 1-sigma error bar (on y).
    * `Ener_spec_LED_obs.txt` : same for LED
* lightcurve:
    * `Lightcurve_HED_obs.txt` : for HED, first column is the tine bin edges (ms) and second is counts per bin per bin size. Third column is the x-bin half-size. Fourth column is the 1-sigma error bar (on y).
    * `Lightcurve_LED_obs.txt` : same for LED

and simulated data:
* Energy spectrum:
    * `Ener_spec_HED_simulation.txt` : for HED, first column is the energy bin edges (keV) and second is counts per bin per bin size.
    * `Ener_spec_LED_simulation.txt` : same for LED
* lightcurve:
    * `Lightcurve_HED_simulation.txt` : for HED, first column is the time bin edges (ms) and second is counts per bin per bin size.
    * `Lightcurve_LED_simulation.txt` : same for LED
